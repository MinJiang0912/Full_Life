# Full-Life

We made a prototype of a PWD friendly application used for tracking tasks and appointments. 
Our app has the following functionality so far:
1st Sprint:
1. Basic Checklist
2. Home page
3. Navigation buttons
4. Adding Tasks to the checklist
5. Deleting tasks from the checklist
6. Editing tasks in the checklist
7. Countdown timers for the remaining time until a task is to be started.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd Sprint:
1. Picture along with the reminder
2. Notification when the countdown timer reaches 0
3. Storing tasks in a database
4. Retrieve tasks from the database when the application loads
5. Calling a default number
6. Displaying the tasks in the order of their due times
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3rd Sprint:
1. Added Microphone Recording functionality for custom ring tones
2. Added completed tasks list
3. Added completed tasks list graph
4. Added increased firebase with storing images and audio files
5. Revamped GUI
6. Added caregiver and patient side implementation

Our app will work with Nougat(7.0) operating systems and up.

WARNING: Our .gradle size is 1.31 GB. CSIL computers which allocate 2GB per member may run into space issues 
unless they store the .gradle elsewhere, like in sfuhome.
